Due to the infinite wisdom of our compatriots, British people in Europe have until the end of 2020 to exchange driving licenses for a European counterpart.  
Due to COVID, appointments to make the exchange are severly limited in Spain.  

I'm using this script to check the website and alert me when new appointments become available in Barcelona or Tarragona.  
If you want to run it too, fork this repo and enable it in your CircleCI account. It'll be pretty noisy - you'll get mails on each run, a successful run indicates there may be slots available, check the logs to see where. You can modify the constants in the script to check different cities.  

Good luck and Fork Boris!
